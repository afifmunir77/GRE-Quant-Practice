        "question": "Mitchell plans to work at a day camp over the summer. Each week, he will be paid according to the following schedule: at the end of the first week, he will receive $1. At the end of each subsequent week, he will receive $1, plus an additional amount equal to the sum of all payments he’s received in previous weeks. How much money will Mitchell be paid in total during the summer, if he works for the entire duration of the 8-week-long camp?",
        "correctAnswer": "255",
        "explanation": "Mitchell's payments double each week: Week 1: $1, Week 2: $1 + $1 = $2, Week 3: $1 + $2 + $1 = $4, and so on. This follows the pattern of powers of 2: $1, $2, $4, $8, $16, $32, $64, $128. The total is $255 (sum of 2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^7)."
