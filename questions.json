        "question": "Mitchell plans to work at a day camp over the summer. Each week, he will be paid according to the following schedule: at the end of the first week, he will receive $1. At the end of each subsequent week, he will receive $1, plus an additional amount equal to the sum of all payments heâ€™s received in previous weeks. How much money will Mitchell be paid in total during the summer, if he works for the entire duration of the 8-week-long camp?",
        "correctAnswer": "255",
        "explanation": "Mitchell's payments double each week: Week 1: $1, Week 2: $1 + $1 = $2, Week 3: $1 + $2 + $1 = $4, and so on. This follows the pattern of powers of 2: $1, $2, $4, $8, $16, $32, $64, $128. The total is $255 (sum of 2^0 + 2^1 + ... + 2^7)."
